    // it will be better to make arrow knife skin change.
    // like once you tap the arrow "right" skin changes 
    // it will make one skin appear on the screen at a time
    // when skins will end up the arrow will become unclickable and grey color


    // the enemy skin changes depending on what level we have. I will make playerprefs for that

    // still cant figure how to make enemy rotate in the different way each time...make multiple levels? or maybe just randomise 'em.

    // probably someone who reads this or monitors my github commits may be like: "why didnt he make core mechaincs first?"
    // the answer for that is that I need experience with more like..organisation stuff, UI etc
    // i made a bunch of prototypes with just core mechanics and nothing else.
    // in this particular game the core mechanics are simple and dumb so I can develop then whenever I want
    // I gotta make "bussiness logic" first (as uncle Bob would say)


    //tasks: 
    //- make "left knives to win" -UI
    //- a nice skin selection UI
    //- stats!
    //- appleSpawn and appropriate spawn script
    //- and sounds
    //- add particles
    //- add outline using shadergraph
    //- tweening))) who knows - knows
    //- lvl transitions
    //- haptic feedback
    //- log destroy - delay between knife throws
    //- adjustable screen size
    //- screen shake on gameover
